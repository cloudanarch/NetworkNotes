# Cable Standards

## Plenum vs. Non-Plenum

### Plenum

- Open air above ceiling
- Prone to fire
- Cables that go through here must be more fire resistant 
- Can't produce toxic fumes. 

### Non-Plenum

- Encapsulated inside piping etc

## Ethernet over HDMI

### IEEE 1902-2013

- HDMI over ethernet
- HDMI 1.4 adds second channel to add networking. 
    > send and recieve 100MB/s
    > Can still do audio and video simultaneously. 

## Ethernet over powerline

- Can do ethernet through the standard powerline if you need to.
    > Need powerline adapters which plug into outlets. 
    > Have RJ-45 built in port. 
        > Plug modem into ending adapter. 
        > Electrical wiring will deliver data. 

## Cable Standards

### 10BASE-T

- 10 is maximum sppeed (10mbps)
- Baseband Transmission
- T = twisted pair cable

### 10BASE-2

- Thin Ethernet
- 10mbps
- 200 meters
- coaxial

### 100BASE-T

- Max 100mbps
- Cat5+ UTP
- Max length is 100 meters
- "fast ethernet" 

### 100BASE-FX

- 100mbps
- FX = Fiber Optic
- max - 400 half duplex and 2km full duplex. 

## Gigabit Standards

### 1000 BASE-T

- 1000mbps
- Cat5 UTP + 
- Max 100m
- uses 4 bidirectional 

### 1000 BASE-TX

- similar to T
- Easier to setup with only 2 unidirectional pairs 
- never caught on 
- known as failure in commercial implementation

## 10GB standard

### 10G BASE - t

- 2006
- Shielded and Unshielded TP 
- Cat6a = 100m <MINIMUM>
- Cat6 = 55m 
- 1000 mbps

### 10G BASE - LR

- SMF
- 10km

### 10G BASE - sr

- multimode Fiber
- short range
- 300m

### 10G BASE - er

- extended range
- 40km 

### 10G BASE - sw

- Specifically for SONET 
    > Synchronous optical networks. 
- 300m
