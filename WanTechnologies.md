# WAN Technologies

- Data is divided into data packets sent individually using two methods


## Packet Switching

- different routes to destination
- at destination they are recompiled
- known as connecitonless
- internet mostly uses this

## Circuit Switching 

- sends individually as well
- uses same dedicated route

    > example : Telephone lines

## ISDN

- Digital Transmission over phone lines
- sends over 128kbps which is better than 56kbps
- never caught on due to advancements. 

## T1

- 1.544mbps
- 24 channels
- each carries 64kbps
- voice or data traffic 

## T3

- 43mbps
- 672 channels
- carries 64kbps
- used mostly by ISP to backbone

## E1

- Format for europe digital transmission
- 2mbps
- 32 channels 
- 64kbps data

## E3
    
- Less channels than T3
- European

## OCx

- Fiber optic tech
- 51.84 multiples x = speed 



### MISC 

- ESS (extended service set) is a WLAN containing two or more APs

- BSS (basic service set) is a WLAN containing one AP. 

- Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) WLAN can be created without the use of an access point (AP). 

    > AdHoc/Temporary

-  Question 1 :	What locally significant identifier is used by a Frame Relay network to reference a virtual circuit?

    > The Data link Connection Identifier signifies the local node. 

- An ATM cell features a 48-byte data area. 

- The MPLS header is 32 bits in length. Inside this header is the label itself. 

- The DMVPN is a powerful option for hub-and-spoke WAN environments. 

- PAP is rarely seen in use today because it is a clear-text protocol. 

- The HFC typically features multiple media types.
