## Ethernet

- 802.3ad is the open standard version of link aggregation. 

- IEEE 802.3af standard specifies 15.4W as the maximum amount of power a switch is allowed to provide per port.

- Switch Collision

    > A random back-off timer is used in the CSMA/CD network once a collision is detected. 

- Switch Mirroring 

     > Port mirroring permits frame analysis in a switched network. 

- VLANS: 

    > VLANs are also IP subnets. A router must route between these subnets. The VLAN is also a broadcast domain.

    > The 802.1Q native VLAN is the only VLAN in the Layer 2 domain that is not tagged. 

- 802.1X features a supplicant, an authentication server, and an authenticator. The authentication server is responsible for actually checking the credentials.
