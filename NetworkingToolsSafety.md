# Networking Tools & Safety

### Wire crimper

- most common tool. 
- crimps adapters such as RJ-45 to twisted pair cables. 

### Punch down tool

- resembles screwdriver. 
- punches down wires to a punch-down block. 

### Media Tester

- Used to test networking cables.
- Makes sure its wired correctly (pins etc)
- connects both ends to tester. 

### Cable stripper

- removes plastic shielding required to crimp. 
- cable inserted into tools and tool removes outer shielding. 

### TDR (Time domain reflector)

- Electronic equipment used to test cables, such as unshielded twisted pair and coaxial. 
- Transmits signal through cable which is reflected back thru TDR. 
- TDR analyzes reflected signal to pinpoint possible problems. 

    > Possible Problems: 
        
        > Conductors
        > Loose Connectors
        > Shorts
        > Crimps
        > Bends 

### OTDR (Optical TDR)

- Transmits lights rather than signal for fiber. 

### Multimeter

- Used to detect electrical circuits
- Used in many trades
- Measures voltage, resistance, currant and continuanity. 
- Analog AND digital versions

### Butt Set 

- Device resembles telephone
- Used to test and monitor telephone lines
- Hooks up device (red and black wire)
- "butts into" line to determine if there are problems such as:

        > hearing noise
        > listening for dial tones

### Voltage Event Recorder

- Device used to collect data about the quality of electrical power. 
- Checks for: 

        > Sags
        > Swells
        > Variations in freq. 

- Comes with installed computer software
- Data is downloaded and analyzed. 

### Tone Generator 

- Used to Isolate Cables
- "Fox and Hound" 
- Used to locate cable from one end to another. 

        > Used if hard to isolate cable from one end to another .

    > How to use: 

        > Connect at one end.
        > Generate tone thru cable. (fox)
        > Other part of tool will detect sound and pinpoint correct cable. (hound)
    
### Protocol Analyzer

- Also known as a packet sniffer. 
- Software OR Hardware
- Troubleshoot AND Analyze traffic on a network.

    > Such as:


        > Logs
        > Data Packets
        > Broadcasts... etc

    > It can detect:

        > Network Problems
        > Intrusion Attemps
        > Monitors Networking Issues. 

- A common software protocol analyzer would be [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) (downloadable for free)

### Anti-Virus

- Program alters way program operates.
- Most viruses are xferd from internet. 

        > Websites
        > Email
        > Downloadable content

- Can damage servers and computers on network
- Scans for viruses on HDD, targets and destroys/quarantines before damage happens.

    > Must stay with current updates to maintain protection

        > Scan on regular basis. 

### ESD (electrostatic discharge)

- Must protect hardware from ESD
- Two objects of opposite charge create sudden charge of electricity through objects. 
- Can permanently damage hardware.
- Wear ESD Wrist Strap to stop buildup in your body by grounding you

    > How it works

        > Wear an ESD strap on wrist on one end
        > Either ground other end with grounding pin, outlet, or metal case of PC. 

- Can also use an ESD Mat

    > Placed on Desk

        > connected similarily
        > Place device on mat to remove ESD

### MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)

- How to dispose of certain harmful hardware.

    > Such as

        > Mercury
        > Lead
        > Etc

- Provided by manufacturer or EPA. 

### Various Safety Tips 

- Turn off power and unplug power cable (most important)

    > Prevents against: 

        > Personal Shock
        > Hardware Damage

- Remove any jewelry

    > Such as

        > Rings
        > Bracelets
        > Wrist Watches

- Take note of where nearest fire extinguisher is. 

    > Make sure: 

        > You know how to use it
        > You need a Class C (for elec fire)
        > Class C uses dry chemical powder. 

- Cable Management

    > To prevent

        > Tripping hazards
        
    > Solution

        > Dont have exposed cables across walkway. 
        > If they can't be moved off floor, use a "cable manager cover" to organize cables in high traffic walking areas. 

- Proper Lifting. 

    > Don't use your back

    > Use Your Legs:

        > Keep Feet shoulder width apart. 
        > Squad Down. 
        > Keep back straight. 
        > Lift by straightening legs slowly.
