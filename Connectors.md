# Connectors

### RJ-11

- Telephone Jack
- Found often on modems
- hinged locking tab. 
- Resembles smaller RJ-45

### RJ-45 

- Most Common network Connector
- Locks with hinged tab.

### RJ-48c

- Looks similar but with Shielded Twisted Pair
- Found with t1 lines.

### UTP Coupler

- used to connect UTP network cables. 
- used when you can't run a longer cable. 

### BNC connector 

- common RF connector
- analog and digital video
- and audio
- coaxial

### BNC coupler

- connects two coaxial 

### Fiber coupler

- can join two fiber optic connecots
- can only use SAME cables. (ST/ST)

### F type

- threaded and used for coaxial
- commonly used to hand tighten nut to modems, 

### USB connector

- Type A and B 

### IEEE 1394 

- D shaped FIREWIRE. 
- Cameras/Printers rather than networks

### MT-RJ 

- Fiber cable connector
- latched push/pull
- small form factor

### ST Connector

- half twist bayonet fiber connector
- single mode fiber optic cable. 


### LC Connector

- Commonly used between floors in a building. 
- Similar to RJ-45 Style
- Fiber optic connector. 

### SC 

- Standard Push pull
- Also used between floors. 

### RS=232

- Serial (one bit at a time)
- This is most common (VGA type)
- DB-9/DB-25

## APC vs UPC

- UPC signal loss reflects back over connection. 
- APC reduces signal bounce back/signal loss.

    > Has an angle on tip so it doesn't reflect directly back (ie 45 degree angle)
    > Greatly reduces signal loss.
