#Subnetting

"Breaking down large network into smaller network, or subnets" 
Makes Networks more manageable. 

- Having too many IPs can create excess traffic
- Too hard to pinpoint
- If you're in multiple locations it creates a problem

Breaking Down into Subnets makes it better.

- Change default subnet mask by "borrowing" host bits to create subnets. 

## Subnet formula

#### 2^n - 2
##### n = number of bits
